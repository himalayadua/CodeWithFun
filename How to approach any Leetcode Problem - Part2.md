# How to approach any Leetcode Problem - Part2

## Let's take a look at another example:
**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: false

### Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]

Output: true

## Step 1. Understand the problem:
To understand the problem, you would `note the following key` points:

- The input is an **integer array** called nums.
- The goal is to determine whether **any value** appears at least twice in the array.
- If any value appears at least twice, the function should return true. Otherwise, it should return false.


### Analyze the input size: 
In this problem, the input size is relatively small. The size of the `nums` array can vary, but it does not seem to be exceptionally large.

### Look for patterns or restrictions:
The problem statement does not mention any specific patterns or restrictions. However, it states that 
- the solution should return true if **any value** appears at least twice and 
- it's not required to check all the remaining values.

### Consider the data types and ranges:
The input `nums` is specified as an integer array. The problem statement does not mention any specific range for the integer values in the array.

### Think about corner cases and extreme scenarios:
Let's consider some potential corner cases and extreme scenarios:
   - Empty array: What if the input array is empty? In this case, there are no elements, so no value can appear twice. The expected output would be false.
   - Single element: What if the input array has only one element, such as `[1]`? Since there is only one element, it cannot appear twice. The expected output would be false.
   - All elements are the same: What if all elements in the array are the same, such as `[1, 1, 1, 1]`? In this case, the value 1 appears multiple times, so the expected output would be true.
   - Large input size: What if the input array has a very large size, such as `[1, 2, 3, ..., 999999]`? This helps assess whether the solution can handle larger input sizes efficiently.

### Consider time and space complexity requirements:
The problem does not explicitly mention any time or space complexity requirements. However, it is generally desirable to provide an efficient solution with a reasonable time complexity.




## Step 2: Clarify doubts and ask questions.

After understanding the problem statement and considering potential constraints and edge cases, you may have some doubts or questions that need clarification. Let's go through the checklist and see how to approach this step:

1. **Is the problem statement clear?** In this case, the problem statement is relatively clear. It asks us to determine if any value appears at least twice in the given array.

2. **Are there any terms or concepts that require further explanation?** The problem statement uses simple terms and does not introduce any complex concepts. It uses the terms "integer array," "value," and "distinct elements," which are familiar to a software engineer.

3. **Do you need to handle any specific data types or ranges?** The problem does not specify any particular data types or ranges for the input array of integers. It allows for a generic integer array.

4. **Is there any required input or output format?** The problem does not specify any specific input or output format. It expects a **boolean output** indicating whether any value appears at least twice in the array.

5. **Are there any constraints on the time or space complexity?** The problem does not mention any explicit constraints on the time or space complexity. As a beginner, it can be assumed that an efficient solution is desirable, but no specific complexity requirements are given.

6. **Should the solution be optimized for a specific use case or scenario?** The problem does not mention any specific use case or scenario that requires optimization. It seems to be a general case problem.

7. **Are there any dependencies on external systems or libraries?** The problem does not indicate any dependencies on external systems or libraries. We can assume that the solution should be implemented using only standard programming constructs and the provided programming language.


## Step 3: Define the problem's inputs and outputs.

To define the problem's inputs and outputs, we need to identify the specific variables and data structures that will be used. Let's perform this step using the example problem:

**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums`, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

1. **Identify the inputs:**
   - The input to the problem is an integer array called `nums`. It represents the array of numbers we need to analyze.
   - The array `nums` can contain zero or more integer elements.

2. **Identify the outputs:**
   - The output of the problem is a boolean value (either true or false).
   - If any value appears at least twice in the `nums` array, the output should be true.
   - If every element in the `nums` array is distinct (no value appears twice), the output should be false.

3. **Define the function signature:**
   - Based on the identified inputs and outputs, we can define the function signature as follows:
     ```python
     def containsDuplicate(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
     ```

4. **Summary:**
   - The function `containsDuplicate` takes an integer array `nums` as input.
   - It returns a boolean value (true or false) based on whether any value appears at least twice in the `nums` array.




## Step 4: Formulate examples.
Fortunately, leetcode does this for you.
In a real interview, feel free to ask for examples.

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: false

### Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]

Output: true


## Step 5: Break down the problem.

Breaking down the problem involves identifying the key subtasks or steps required to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem using the example provided:

**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums`, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. **Create a data structure unique values:** set, or array. a flag variable to store False.

2. **Iterate through the array:** using a loop logic.

3. **Check for duplicates:** match against the store created in step 1.

4. **Add unique elements to the set:** if no match found, add it to the store.  if match is found, set flag variable to True and return.

5. **Return false if no duplicates are found:** if no duplicates encountered, return flag variable.



## Step 6: Design an algorithm.

Designing an algorithm involves devising a plan or strategy to solve the problem efficiently. Let's design an algorithm for the given example problem using a step-by-step approach:

**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums`, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

1. **Create a set to store unique values:** Initialize an empty set called `unique_set` to store unique values encountered in the array.

2. **Iterate through the array:** Start iterating over each element, `num`, in the `nums` array.

3. **Check for duplicates:**
   - For each element, check if it already exists in the `unique_set`.
   - If it does, return `True` since we have found a duplicate value.
   - If it doesn't, proceed to the next step.

4. **Add unique elements to the set:** If the element does not exist in the `unique_set`, add it to the set to keep track of unique values.

5. **Return false if no duplicates are found:** After iterating through all elements in the array, if no duplicates were found, return `False` since every element is distinct.




## Step 7: Choose appropriate data structures.

Selecting appropriate data structures is crucial for efficient problem solving. Let's determine the suitable data structures for the given example problem using a step-by-step approach:

**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums`, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

1. **Identify the data structures needed:**
   - We need a data structure to store unique values encountered in the array.
   - We need a data structure that allows efficient lookup to check for duplicates.

2. **Consider the requirements and operations:**
   - We need to efficiently check if a value exists in the data structure.
   - We need to efficiently add values to the data structure.
   - We do not require any specific ordering of elements.

3. **Evaluate potential data structures:**
   - Set: A set data structure provides efficient lookup and insertion operations. It ensures uniqueness by not allowing duplicate elements.
   - List: A list does not provide efficient lookup for duplicates, as it requires iterating through the entire list.

4. **Choose the appropriate data structure:**
   - Based on the above evaluation, the most suitable data structure for this problem is a set.
   - Using a set, we can efficiently check for duplicates and add unique elements as we iterate through the array.


### More comparisons:

1. **Set:**
   - A set data structure ensures uniqueness by not allowing duplicate elements to be stored.
   - It provides efficient lookup and insertion operations with an average time complexity of O(1).
   - Sets are particularly useful when we need to check for duplicates and store unique values.

2. **Array/List:**
   - Arrays or lists are commonly used data structures for storing collections of elements.
   - They allow duplicate elements and do not provide built-in mechanisms for efficient duplicate checking.
   - Checking for duplicates in an array or list typically requires iterating through the entire collection, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array or list.
   - Arrays/lists are generally more suitable when the order of elements is important or when duplicates need to be retained.

3. **Dictionary/Map:**
   - Dictionaries or maps are key-value data structures that associate a value with a unique key.
   - While dictionaries can be used to solve this problem, they are not the most efficient choice.
   - Dictionaries provide efficient lookup operations with an average time complexity of O(1) when accessing values based on keys.
   - However, dictionaries require additional space to store both keys and values, which may not be necessary in this problem where we only need to track unique values.

4. **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
   - BSTs are tree-based data structures that maintain a sorted order of elements.
   - While BSTs can be used to solve this problem, they are not the most efficient choice.
   - BSTs provide efficient insertion and lookup operations with a time complexity of O(log n) on average.
   - However, maintaining the sorted order of elements in a BST may not be necessary for this problem, where we only need to check for duplicates efficiently.

Comparing these data types to the set data structure:

- Arrays/lists require iterating through the entire collection to check for duplicates, resulting in a higher time complexity compared to the efficient O(1) lookup provided by sets.
- Dictionaries/maps come with additional overhead to store both keys and values, which may not be necessary for this problem, making sets a more space-efficient choice.
- BSTs provide efficient lookup operations but require maintaining a sorted order, which is unnecessary for this problem, making sets a simpler and more suitable choice.



## Step 8: Implement the algorithm.

Let's take the algorithm designed in step 6 and provide an example of how it can be implemented in code during step 8. 

**Algorithm (from step 6):**

1. Create a set to store unique values.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. Check for duplicates:
   - If a duplicate is found, return `True`.
   - If not, proceed to the next step.
4. Add unique elements to the set.
5. Return `False` if no duplicates are found.

Here's an example implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    unique_set = set()  # Create a set to store unique values
    
    for num in nums:  # Iterate through the array
        if num in unique_set:  # Check for duplicates
            return True  # Return true if a duplicate is found
        
        unique_set.add(num)  # Add unique elements to the set
    
    return False  # Return false if no duplicates are found
```

In this implementation, the `containsDuplicate` function receives an integer array `nums` as the input. It follows the steps outlined in the algorithm:

1. It creates an empty set called `unique_set` to store unique values encountered in the array.
2. It iterates through the `nums` array using a loop.
3. For each element, it checks if it already exists in the `unique_set`. If it does, it immediately returns `True` since a duplicate is found.
4. If the element is not already in the `unique_set`, it adds it to the set to keep track of unique values.
5. After iterating through all elements, if no duplicates are found, it returns `False` since every element is distinct.

By implementing this code, we have transformed the algorithm into executable code, allowing us to solve the problem effectively.


## Step 9: Test your solution
Also handled seamlessly by leetcode.
In real interview, you are expected to use the examples provided and feed them into the code to check if the result matches expectations.



## Step 10: Analyze the time and space complexity.

To analyze the time and space complexity of the implemented code, you can follow this step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the operations:** Identify the key operations in your code that consume time and space resources. Focus on loops, function calls, and data structure operations such as insertions, deletions, and lookups.

2. **Assign time complexity:** Determine the time complexity of each identified operation. Use Big O notation to describe how the runtime grows in relation to the size of the input. Consider the worst-case scenario.

3. **Calculate the overall time complexity:** Calculate the overall time complexity of your code by considering the time complexities of the individual operations. Determine the dominant factor that contributes the most to the overall time complexity.

4. **Assign space complexity:** Determine the space complexity of your code, which refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm. Consider the additional space used by data structures, recursive calls, and temporary variables.

5. **Calculate the overall space complexity:** Calculate the overall space complexity of your code by considering the maximum space used at any point during the execution.

6. **Consider trade-offs:** Evaluate the time and space complexity in relation to each other. Determine whether the code is optimized for time or space efficiency or strikes a balance between the two.

By following this process, you can obtain a clear understanding of the efficiency of your code in terms of time and space usage.

For example, let's consider the time and space complexity analysis for the `containsDuplicate` function implemented in the previous step:

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    unique_set = set()
    
    for num in nums:
        if num in unique_set:
            return True
        
        unique_set.add(num)
    
    return False
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the `nums` array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
- The `if` statement performs a lookup in the `unique_set` using the `in` operator, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for a set.
- The `unique_set.add(num)` operation also has an average time complexity of O(1) for adding elements to a set.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the `containsDuplicate` function is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**
- The space complexity of the function is determined by the additional space used by the `unique_set` set. The space used by the set grows with the number of unique elements encountered in the array.
- In the worst-case scenario, if there are no duplicates in the array, the `unique_set` set would store all the unique elements, resulting in a space complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
- In the best-case scenario, if a duplicate is found early in the array, the space complexity would be O(1) as only a single duplicate needs to be stored.

Therefore, the overall space complexity of the `containsDuplicate` function is O(n) in the worst case and O(1) in the best case.

By analyzing the time and space complexity, you can assess the efficiency and scalability of your code, make informed decisions, and understand how it will perform with larger inputs.
