## Intuition
Greedy algorithm.

Sorting the whole array nums is easy, but the time complexity is raised up to O(nlogn).

Try nth_element to find the 4 smallest & 4 biggest ints, then sort.

Python solution is 1-liner using sorting the whole nums.

3rd approach uses maxheap & minheap to hold 4 smallest, biggest elements. This solution is linear & run in 26ms Beats 99.74%.

An optimized version is done as a variant for the 1st C++ code by adopting the suggestion of @Sergei avoiding of using extra space. That code has runtime 17ms & beats 100%.

## Approach

1.  When n<=4, just return 0
2.  Use `nth_element` to find the 4 smallest ints & store them in a 4 elemented array `small`; then sort
3.  Use `nth_element` to find the 4 biggest ints & store them in a 4 elemented array `big`; then sort
4.  Consider 4 scenarios min(big[i]-small[i] for i=0...3) which is the answer.
5.  Python 1 liner uses usual sort.
6.  3rd approach uses maxheap `small` & minheap `big` to hold 4 smallest, biggest elements. This solution is linear & run in 26ms Beats 99.74%

## Complexity
==========

-   Time complexity:
O(n)

-   Space complexity:
O(8)=O(1)
