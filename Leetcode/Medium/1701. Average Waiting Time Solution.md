# Solution
Thoughts:
- returns the average waiting time as a float
- there is a single chef at a restaurant
- customers arrive with their arrival time 
    - the time needed to prepare their order
- chef can only prepare food for one customer at a time
- customers must wait until their order is ready

Identify the key variables: 
- you need to keep track of the total waiting time (res) 
- the time when the chef finishes preparing the order for each customer (finish)

Note
- the customers' arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order 
    - you can process them sequentially

Approach
- One possible approach is to iterate over each customer
    - update the chef's finish time based on the current customer
    - calculate the waiting time
    - accumulate it in the res variable

Algo: 
- res, finish variables to 0
- Iterate over each customer in the given list:
    - arrival and the time needed to prepare the order (time)
    - If finish time is > arrival time ---> it means the chef is still busy
        - Update finish += time
    - If finish time < arrival time ---> it means the chef is idle when the current customer arrives
        - finish = arrival + time
    - Calculate the waiting time for the current customer 
    - Calculate the average waiting time by dividing the res variable by the number of customers
- Return the average waiting time.
