# Remove Duplicates in-place from Sorted Array
**Leetcode 26**
[LC1752](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

## Problem Statement: 
Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

If there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of the array should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

> Note: Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of the array.

### Example 1:
Input: arr[1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

Output: arr[1,2,3,_,_,_,_]

Explanation: Total number of unique elements are 3, i.e[1,2,3] and Therefore return 3 after assigning [1,2,3] in the beginning of the array.

### Example 2:
Input: arr[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4]

Output: arr[1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_,_,_]

Explanation: Total number of unique elements are 4, i.e[1,2,3,4] and Therefore return 4 after assigning [1,2,3,4] in the beginning of the array.

## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return *the number of unique elements in *`nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

-   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
-   Return `k`.


### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]

Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]

Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]

Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

### Constraints:

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
-   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
-   `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
