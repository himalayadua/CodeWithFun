# Find the number that appears once, and the other numbers twice
**Leetcode 136**
[LC136](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)

## Problem Statement: 
Given a non-empty array of integers arr, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

### Example 1:
Input Format: arr[] = {2,2,1}

Result: 1

Explanation: In this array, only the element 1 appear once and so it is the answer.

### Example 2:
Input Format: arr[] = {4,1,2,1,2}

Result: 4

Explanation: In this array, only element 4 appear once and the other elements appear twice. So, 4 is the answer.


# Leetcode
## 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

### Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

### Constraints:

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
-   `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
-   Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
